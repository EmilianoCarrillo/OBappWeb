> **An incredible tool developed for incredible students.**

It is a website aplication for the students of the school Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n (Oficial B) Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. 
This page was created because of learning purposes and to help my school comunity.
I first design the concept art and I redisgned (modernized) the school logo, then I made the User Interface. Once I was finished with that I started to add functionality.
[Visit the site here: OficialBapp.com](http://oficialbapp.com)

- It was built entirely on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- It is dinamic (For PCs, tablets and mobile devices).
- This site was also built using a DB as a client (FIREBASE) [psst... It is awesome!]]

### //////////////////// FIREBASE INTEGRATION ////////////////////
I used firebase to:
- Update in real time the notices located at the HomePage screen.
- Authenticate the users with their emails.
- Store user Information such as email, group, and Metadata.
- Store and retrieve each student's done-Homeworks and todo-Homeworks.
- Retrieve in real time the homework on each group.
- Store files from tab "Mi Grupo".
